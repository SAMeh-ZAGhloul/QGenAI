QGenAI Test Document

This is a sample document for testing the QGenAI application.

Section 1: Introduction
QGenAI is a document-based question answering system using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
It allows users to upload documents and ask questions about them.
The system uses a vector database to store document embeddings and retrieves relevant chunks when a query is made.

Section 2: Features
- Document upload and processing
- Document chunking and embedding
- Vector-based retrieval
- Question answering with source citations
- User authentication and query history

Section 3: Technical Details
The backend is built with FastAPI and follows a modular architecture:
- API Layer: Handles HTTP requests and responses
- Core: Contains configuration and security utilities
- Database: Models and session management
- RAG: Implements the Retrieval Augmented Generation pipeline
- Schemas: Pydantic models for data validation

Section 4: LLM Configuration
The backend supports multiple LLM providers:
- OpenAI (GPT models)
- Google Gemini
- Ollama (local models)

Section 5: Test Questions
Here are some sample questions you can ask about this document:
1. What is QGenAI?
2. What features does QGenAI offer?
3. What LLM providers are supported?
4. How is the backend structured?
5. What is RAG?
